### **Code example:**
**KATA from CODEWARS:** Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.
``` js
function lovefunc(flower1, flower2){
  return flower1 % 2 !== flower2 % 2;
}
